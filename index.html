  Steve Mould was able to predict his child's delivery time twice using his wife's contraction data.

     I predicted the exact time of my daughter's birth using science and data - from Just For Graphs
  </a>

  Using the data from his video:
  <div>
    <img src="data/baby1.png"/>
  </div> 
  <div>
    <img src="data/baby1b.png"/>
  </div> 
  <div>
    <img src="data/baby2.png"/>
  </div>
  I hope to put together a tool to help you predict your child's birth.
